# Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit

To test your learning, you will create a solution "from scratch".
Place your code between the indicated lines and it will be tested against
multiple test cases.

The algorithm to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit is the temperature
in Celsius times 9/5, plus 32.

You are given a variable celsius representing a temperature in Celsius.
Use the variable fahrenheit already defined and apply the algorithm to assign
it the corresponding temperature in Fahrenheit.

## Note
Don't worry too much about the function and return statements as they will be covered in future challenges. For now, only use operators that you have already learned.

### Before

```javascript
function convertToF(celsius) {
  var fahrenheit;
  // Only change code below this line


  // Only change code above this line
  return fahrenheit;
}

// Change the inputs below to test your code
convertToF(30);
```

### Thinking Process

We only need to apply the formula to the var fahrenheit. So we multiply
the args celsius to 9/5 and we finally add 32 at the end.

### Answers

```javascript
function convertToF(celsius) {

  var fahrenheit;
  // Only change code below this line

  fahrenheit = celsius * (9/5) + 32;

  // Only change code above this line
  return fahrenheit;
}

// Change the inputs below to test your code
convertToF(30);
```
